### Installation
- Create an account on Railway
- Connect Railway with your GitHub account
- Click on Deployment Button
- Choose a repository
- Sit Back and relax while it sets up
- Go to the deployment link provided by Railway
- Click on "Connect"
- BOOM!! Your Free VPS is ready to go!

#### Note 1 : GOLang is pre downloaded and extracted, the path is not set. In order to set it, you need to run the following command: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
#### I have made a script "run-after-go.sh", run this once GO path gets set and all necessary tools made in GOLang will be installed.

#### Note 2 : You cannot install tools using terminal. To install any tool fork my repo: https://github.com/vlakhani28/bbht and add/delete tools you want to. Remember to change Line Number 61 in Dockerfile of the repo "vps" and add the link of newly forked repository.

### Limitation(s)
- If left untouched for 30-45 minutes, it gets reset. 
- Your work does not get saved, so save it on cloud like GDrive or you can use UptimeRobot(https://uptimerobot.com/) which will ping your website so the website does not get reset in 30 minutes.

### To-Do(s)
- Find a working solution for Go so that it gets pre-installed
- Add Mounting/Unmounting of GDrive 
- Add telegram notifications
- Add more tools (Twitter DM me if you want any tools to be added https://twitter.com/vlakhani28)
